# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python
This Python script implements a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns to place their mark (either 'X' or 'O') on the board. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
